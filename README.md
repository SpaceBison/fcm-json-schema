# fcm-json-schema
Simple json schema that describes and documents data sent through FCM downstream messages.
Two JSONs: one for sending data to iOS devices, other one for android devices.

It directly corresponds to what's on https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref#downstream

Tested and proven in a real app.

If you find that something is malfunctioning, please let me know :)

Works particulary well with http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org or any other tools that might generate PO*O classes.
